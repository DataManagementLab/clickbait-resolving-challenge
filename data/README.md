# Clickbait Resolving Challenge: Download the data

To obtain the data, either clone the repository or download this folder. Afterwards, run the ```download.ipynb``` notebook to obtain the fulltexts of the articles which we cannot provide for download directly due to copyright reasons. You may however contact us via mail if you do not want to recreate the corpus from the sources.

The notebook will download and process the fulltexts and store them in the according folders.

It also contains code to generate additional silver data based on wordnet as described in the paper.
