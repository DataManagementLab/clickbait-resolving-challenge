title: Clickbait Resolving Challenge
---

We present a new corpus of clickbait articles annotated by university students along with a corresponding shared task: clickbait articles use a headline or teaser that on purpose hides information from the reader to get them curious to open the article. We therefore propose to construct approaches that can automatically extract the relevant information from such an article, which we call *clickbait resolving*.
